Climate related API access examples

In this code file [road_googlemaps_api_milk.R](https://github.com/AnabelleCouleau/api_examples/blob/main/road_googlemaps_api_milk.R), I use Google Maps API to map the routes between municipalities pairs where milk is transported in Colombia. Then I identify all the municipalities the route crosses. Which allows me to match whether landslides ("derrumbes") occured on that route where milk is transported.
